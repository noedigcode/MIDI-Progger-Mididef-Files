# MIDI Progger mididef files

> A simple text file can make all the change in the world


Your regular scheduled program is changed for this important message:

These are mididef files which contain MIDI program names and numbers (MSB, LSB, program) for synthesizers. These files are loaded by MIDI Progger and allow you to search for and send program changes to your favourite synth.

Simply copy the files to your "mididef" directory in your filesystem root.
